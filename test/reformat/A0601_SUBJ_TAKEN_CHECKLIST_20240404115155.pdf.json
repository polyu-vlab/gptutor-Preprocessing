As a general reference, the credits you have attained should be\nproportional to the stage you are on the programme.  That is, if the normal duration of your programme is 4 years and you have already studied for 2 years, you should have completed\nhalf of the credits required.  In addition, all GUR subjects should normally be completed within the first 2 years of study.  If you wish to seek advice on your study plan, you can approach\nyour academic advisor of your host department.\n********************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************\nPoints to Note:\n1.\nThe checklist is for reference purpose and students should refer to the relevant Programme Requirement Document(s) for the detailed subject/credit requirements for completing the\nprogramme(s). They should contact the relevant Programme Offering Department(s) if they have any queries related to the requirements, including discrepancies found between the\nProgramme Requirement Document(s) and the checklist.\n2.\nThe checklist shows the Set(s) of graduation requirements (composing of various subsets) on the Major, Secondary Major and/or Minor programmes, as well as other university\nrequirements, which are shown under \u201cNature Requirement\u201d and \u201cOther Graduation Requirement\u201d.  Some programmes may have more than 1 Sets of graduation requirements.  To\nbe eligible for graduation, a student has to fulfil all requirements listed in the subsets within one of the Sets (i.e. Major and/or Secondary Major, and Minor, if any).  In addition, the\n\u2018Nature Requirement\u2019 and \u2018Other Graduation Requirement\u2019 must all be satisfied.\n3.\nALL subjects required under DSR and LCR will be shown, except in the case of the following:\n - For \u201cFree Elective\u201d Subset under DSR, \u201conly subjects with grade(s)/registration record(s) and under the \u201cUg-Free Elective Pool (2012 Curriculum)\u201d or \u201cselected to fulfil the Free\nElective requirement\u201d will be shown\n - For GUR (except LCR), only subjects with grade(s)/registration records will be shown\n4.\nIn addition to the finalised subject grades (display after subject result announcement), the following codes will also be displayed under the column of Subject Result:\nR\n-\nSubject Registered\nT\n-\nCredit Transfer without Grade\nW\nSubject Withdrawal\n-\n(Grade granted by Credit Transfer is shown in brackets)\nZ\nLA\n-\nLate Assessment (Pending)\n-\nSubject Exemption\nRC\n-\nSubject(s) with Recognised Credits (RC) will be taken as fulfilling the requirement for the subset. However, these subjects will not be counted towards credits\nattained and therefore will not be counted under the \u201cSubset Credit\u201d column.\n#\n-\nSubject(s) approved to be double counted for fulfilling the graduation requirements of both Major and Minor programmes.\n&\n-\nSubject(s) selected to be double counted for fulfilling the graduation requirements of both Major and Secondary Major programmes in the last \u201cApplication for\nGraduation\u201d exercise\n@\n-\nFree Elective subject(s) selected in the last \u201cApplication for Graduation\u201d exercise.\nIf you have not eventually graduated in the last \u201cApplication for Graduation\u201d exercise, you will need to re-apply for graduation and re-select the \u201cFree Elective subject(s)\u201d and/or\n\u201cDouble Counting subject(s) for Major and Secondary Major programmes\u201d at the semester in which you will graduate.\n5.\nSubset Credits and Subjects marked with \u201cY\u201d under the \u201cDuplicate Indicator\u201d column\nCredits required for the subsets are listed under the \u201cSubset Credit\u201d column.  Some subjects taken may meet more than one Subset requirements and they are marked with \u2018Y\u2019\nunder the \u2018Duplicate Indicator\u2019 column. Please note that these subjects can eventually fulfil only one of these subsets for graduation as double counting will not be applicable. Thus,\nstudents are required to take another subject in these subsets in order to fulfil the graduation requirements.\nExamples:\nSubset Description\nSubset Credit\nSubject Code\nSubject Title\nSubject\nCredit\nSubject\nResult\nYear/Sem\nDuplicate\nIndicator\n(LCR-Chinese)\n0 of 0 ^1\nP\n0 of 0 ^2\nDD1Q01\n0\n2022/1\nESSENTIAL COMPONENTS OF GENERAL\nEDUCATION\n(GE Essential Components)\n(Subj.

Students enrolling in Bachelor\u2019s Degree programmes\nare required to apply for graduation in the semester which they are expected to graduate.  Students can refer to the set of FAQs located next to the \u201cApplication for Graduation\u201d\nunder \u201ceStudent > My Profile > Study Information\u201d page for details of the arrangements.  They are also required to select the following subjects during the application process where\nappropriate:\n- Subjects fulfilling the Free Elective Requirement\n- Double Counting Subjects for Major and Secondary Major programmes\n"
